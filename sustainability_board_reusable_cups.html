        As the first few weeks of
        the new school year begin
        to settle in, a new Wheaton
        Sustainability Board initiative has been launched:
        reusable cups that save
        students money when used
        at the on-campus Starbucks
        were up for raffle. In an
        event spanning from Aug.
        31 to Sept. 13, 100 new Sustainability Board-branded
        cups have been raffled off to
        some lucky Wheaton students. The raffle, which was
        available to enter online,
        selected winners using a
        wheel. Each cup can be used
        at dining locations around
        campus, but when used
        in person at the Starbucks
        attached to the 1834 Grill,
        the cup can save the user 25
        cents on any drink made and
        served in the cup.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        When asked via email
        about the new initiative, the
        Sustainability Board’s Vice
        Chair, Jill Imrie ‘27, said, “We
        are encouraging sustainability
        and rejecting consumerism with
        this project.” Imrie continued
        stating that the Sustainability
        Board’s “ultimate goal is to
        eventually work with the college
        to give out these cups, or something similar, to all incoming
        freshmen. This would create an
        environment where sustainable
        practices are everyday practices
        for our Wheaton community.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        While the raffle for these
        cups has concluded, the Sustainability Board has numerous
        upcoming initiatives that promote sustainability. Past events
        include distributing sustainable
        period products, campus cleanups, pollinator picnics, and the
        semiannual clothing swap with
        Ecco House. To stay up-to-date
        on these events and future sustainability initiatives, follow the
        board on Instagram @wheatonsustainability or join their page
        on Engage to receive email reminders of meetings and events.
