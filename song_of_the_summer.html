        Gen Z has a general tendency
        to label each summer through a
        song and/or album that dominated
        the charts. Last year was one of
        the best for pop music in a while;
        the song “Espresso” by Sabrina
        Carpenter and the album “Brat” by
        Charli xcx are emblematic of that
        time. The cultural impact of “Brat”
        in particular led to the summer of
        2024 being unanimously dubbed
        “Brat Summer.”

        Expectations for the music of
        2025 ran high after such an iconic
        year of hits, which led to relative
        uproar over the lack of a ‘song of
        the summer’ this year. Yes, songs
        like “Ordinary” by Alex Warren,
        “What I Want” by Morgan Wal-
        len featuring Tate McRae, and
        “Golden” from the soundtrack
        of the Netflix movie “KPop Demon Hunters”, were undoubtedly
        extremely popular. However, they
        have lacked the impact needed
        to define the whole season. As a
        result, many people, including myself, have picked their own songs
        of the summer that defined their
        life during that period. Here are
        my candidates:

        McKinley Dixon released his
        newest studio album “Magic,
        Alive!” on Jun. 6. This jazz rap
        album features mesmerizing jazz
        arrangements backing Dixon’s
        voice to create one of the most
        memorable musical experiences
        I have had in 2025. The tracks
        “Sugar Water”, featuring Quelle
        Chris and Anjimile, and “Could’ve
        Been Different”, featuring Blu and
        Shamir, are two potent examples
        of the album’s identity and what
        makes it so special.

        Another striking musical project was London-based artist Pink
        Pantheress’ mixtape “Fancy That”.
        After its release on May 9, the
        collection of tracks displays Pink
        Pantheress’ evolved musical identity and her general skills in music
        production. I have been a longtime
        fan of Pink Pantheress and found
        “Fancy That” to be my favorite
        project of hers to date. Although
        it is a short listen of just over 20
        minutes, the mixtape shares the
        fun that she had producing it with
        the listener. My favorite tracks
        were “Illegal” and “Romeo” because they stick out in both identity and the infectious amusement
        “Fancy That” contains so much of.

        While the summer 2025 may
        have been unremarkable to many
        listeners, it was still a fruitful
        period for music. “Magic, Alive!”
        and “Fancy That” captured my
        summer, but there have been other
        recent releases that I have found
        particularly noteworthy. “Sincerely” by Kali Uchis, “Eusexua” by
        FKA Twigs, and “Sinister Gift” by
        Panda Bear are just a few more of
        the many high quality albums from
        this year that I recommend exploring.
