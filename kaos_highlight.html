        You may know K-pop through
        several mediums, including the
        new hit animated film “KPop
        Demon Hunters”. The film
        features several well-known
        celebrities as well as real-life
        K-pop idols and singers. You
        also have probably heard songs
        from famous bands such as BTS,
        Seventeen, or KATSEYE, who
        debuted with record success last
        June.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        KAOS aims to capture that
        excitement of Korean culture
        and uses it to perform in several of Wheaton’s dance events,
        including WheaPerform and
        DanceFest. The team also performs covers of popular songs,
        most recently NCT U’s “Make
        a Wish”, and uploads them to
        the group’s Youtube channel
        called KAOS Dance. Some of
        the group’s favorite past performances have come from WheaP-
        erform and DanceFest, with
        most of the exec board citing
        “Gangnam Style” by PSY as a
        fan and team-favorite.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        WheaPerform is one of the
        most important times of the year
        for the group, as a strong first
        showing encourages first-years
        and other students to audition
        for KAOS. Returning members
        range from the class of 2026 to
        the class 2028, and are hoping to
        recruit both members from the
        sophomore class of 2028 and the
        freshman class of 2029. When
        speaking with KAOS, members
        Charlotte Varga ’26 (President),
        Keandre Alexander ’27 (Dance
        Captain), and Heidi Ricker ’28
        (Dance Captain) emphasized the
        importance of having fun, being
        inclusive, and creating an open
        space to help facilitate practices
        and performances.

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The team strongly encourages trying out even if you don’t
        know much K-pop but want to
        join a fun dance group. KAOS
        has a no-experience-needed policy, meaning you can audition
        regardless of how much K-pop
        knowledge and dancing skill you
        have.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Currently practicing three
        times a week, the team works on
        their routines for both recorded
        covers and live dance events.
        Costumes, which can range from
        elaborate to chic, and comfy
        outfits are key parts of their presentation.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The group is actively planning
        their fall semester schedule, and
        is exploring potential collaborations
        with other Wheaton College dance teams.
