        Dear Wheaton,
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        My name is Khushi Parikh and
        I am extremely excited to serve as
        The Wheaton Wire’s co-editor-in-
        chief along with the zealous Moira
        Sankey ’26 this year. A little bit
        about myself: I’m a Mathematics
        and Economics double major from
        Mumbai, India, who loves to seek
        out thrilling adventure activities
        in my free time. I first started my
        journey on The Wheaton Wire’s
        editorial board in the fall of 2021,
        later transitioning from sports editor
        to features editor and treasurer, and
        now to my present role. This was
        actually the first club I joined at
        Wheaton, and it holds a very special
        place in my heart.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        I would like to formally begin this
        letter with a thank you to Professor
        Janice Sklensky-Ratliff, who has
        not only been a brilliant professor
        but also an incredibly supportive
        mentor figure for many mathematics
        students. After working in the
        mathematics department at Wheaton
        for 27 years, she was let go this
        summer with a three-week notice,
        along with many other wonderful
        professors across departments.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        I believe that I am not the only
        student who feels deeply powerless
        in the face of this political attack on
        higher education, which has forced
        colleges across the country to cut
        spending and “transform” DEI
        programs. This is creating an
        environment that has led to a decrease
        in both domestic and international
        student admissions nationwide.
    </p>


    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        At Wheaton alone, international
        student admissions have dropped
        significantly recently. A cut in
        federal spending has led to increased
        tuition, room, and meal plan rates.
        On the academic side, it is not an
        exaggeration to say that the college
        has desperately pivoted to investing
        in more lucrative and attractive
        major programs such as business,
        computer science, nursing and
        design, while traditional liberal arts
        departments in the humanities have
        faced the tragic brunt of this shift,
        impacting not only professors but
        also the capacity to teach a varied
        selection of electives. Park Hall’s
        omnipresence is felt in every building
        and in every department, its
        influence now permeating all major
        and minor matters.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        That being said, it’s important
        to remember that we are a much
        smaller campus than other schools
        that are experiencing similar
        hardships. The Wheaton bubble
        amplifies both personal and
        collective emotions, especially in
        times suffused with uncertainty, as
        students are provided with an intimate
        perspective of peer and staff
        concerns due to the interwoven
        nature of interactions typical of our
        campus community.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        This year’s convocation focused
        on the power of storytelling and
        empathy. I would like to take this
        opportunity to first commend the
        extremely relevant choice of topic
        and second, add that empathy can
        often be expressed through both
        advocacy and action.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Around the world, students and
        citizens are increasingly demanding
        change, including in Nepal, where
        recent protests led primarily by
        Gen-Z have resulted in the upheaval
        of a corrupt government. We express
        concern for anyone in our community
        affected by these events, and we
        recognize moments of progress, such as
        Susila Karki’s historic role as Nepal’s
        first female head of government as
        the interim prime minister.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The youth participation in this
        political movement was quite
        surprising (the youngest of the protestors
        to pass away was only 12 years old,
        according to NDTV, an Indian news
        media company, as of September
        13th), as students leveraged social
        media to organize themselves in a
        decentralized, leaderless manner.
        This is a testament to changing
        times, as a new generation steps
        into the world’s sociopolitical fabric
        and exercises its influence. The
        future is here. This is our time. This
        is our moment.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        As a new academic year begins,
        my sincere wish is for everyone to
        strive to become the best versions
        of themselves, courageously take
        charge of their lives, use their
        voices fearlessly, and be compassionate,
        upright and resilient members
        of society. In turn, those of us at
        The Wire will endeavor to uphold
        these values in our work, as we
        carefully curate and publish issues
        for our campus to engage with.
        We will do our part to inform and
        enrich our community with every
        piece of content that we present to
        our readers.

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Inspired by the students of Nepal,
        I want to sign off with two quotes:
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “The dissident does not operate
        in the realm of genuine power at
        all. He is not seeking power. He
        has no desire for office and does
        not gather votes. He does not
        attempt to charm the public, he offers
        nothing and promises nothing. His
        actions simply articulate his dignity
        as a citizen, regardless of the cost.”
