        The College Hearing Board
        (CHB), charged with addressing
        serious violations of the Honor
        Code and upholding a system of

        justice that is both fair and consistent, serves as a cornerstone

        of student discipline within
        Wheaton College. This body
        ensures that students are held
        accountable for their actions in
        a way that is both transparent

        and equitable, offering a structured process to resolve issues

        of misconduct and safeguard
        the integrity of the academic
        environment. In many ways, the
        Hearing Board acts as a critical
        mechanism through which the

        college enforces its values, balancing the interests of individual

        students with the broader goals
        of maintaining a safe, respectful,
        and orderly campus community.</p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">However, despite the pivotal
        role the Hearing Board plays in
        shaping the campus culture, a
        proverbial disconnect exists: not
        many students are fully aware
        of its existence or its function.

        For all its importance, CHB
        operates largely under the radar,
        and for most students, it remains
        an abstract concept—something
        that, at best, seems distant and at
        worst, entirely irrelevant to their
        everyday college experience.</p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        So, how exactly does the

        Hearing Board work? According to CHB Chair Lauren Lopes

        Class of ‘26, when an incident
        occurs, the student in question
        will be notified that the matter
        has been referred to the CHB.
        A hearing panel is composed of
        three peers (students), including

        the chair and two student members, a Residential Life coordinator, and a professor. CHB

        asks questions and the student
        is given the ability to offer an
        opening statement. They are
        questioned further, and make a
        closing statement.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “Respondents are allowed to
        bring what we call procedural
        advisors...like a support person
        because sometimes these matters
        can be very emotionally draining
        for students,” Lopes states.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        After the hearing is finished,

        the panel evaluates the evidence

        and renders a decision. “So ultimately we all decide like, ‘oh

        we find this person responsible
        for this incident’ and then we
        provide the sanctions, with the
        help of Dean Irish. However, if

        they don’t feel that their responsibility or sanctions are fair or

        they want to appeal we do have
        an Appellant Officer. We’re not
        a part of that process. I’m pretty
        sure the Dean of Students deals
        with that,” Lopes adds.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Despite the process, various
        students on campus express
        concerns, specifically with the
        issue of potential subconscious
        bias within CHB. A sophomore
        who wished to remain anonymous
        said, “I’m worried that with how
        the system is, that there is room
        for personal bias to impact their
        decisions, you know what I mean?

        I mean, we all go to school together so somebody on the board

        might know the person.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Cole Martinez ‘28 says that
        “making it anonymous would
        make it a lot better. There will
        always be bias even if they
        try.” Another student shares
        her discomfort with the system
        saying, “As a person of color I
        do not feel safe going if I had
        to be brought up to the hearing
        board. Even though this is a
        predominantly white institution,
        when they make a decision for a
        student of color I feel that they
        don’t understand.” She spoke
        on the condition of anonymity.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Another student who also
        wished to remain anonymous
        said, “college is a step below

        into fully integrating into society. The issues that society has at

        large will be mirrored in college
        as an institution. So the fact that

        simply just by looking at whoever is being prosecuted, the jury

        is going to be impacted and have
        biases. I think colleges should
        be the front-runners into novel
        methods where people can be
        judged fairly but also receive the
        punishment necessary.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Alumni and former CHB
        Chair Diana Blake expressed
        concern about the consequences
        of making CHB anonymous.

        “We want to hear what was going through the student’s mind,”

        she said. “Maybe it was reported they said something harmful,

        and they admit to saying it but

        truly did not know it was harmful. Say they express genuine

        remorse while saying this. This

        would cause the board to decide
        they have violated a policy, but

        perhaps could give them a different sanction that requires an

        educational piece and a slightly
        lesser sanction.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Blake emphasized the importance of an in-person hearing. “To be transparent, there

        have been times where I have
        read case reports, and would
        have 100% said ‘there’s no
        way they didn’t do this’ and
        delivered a harsher sanction if

        I had not heard from the respondent directly. So this is a

        concern I would have, in which
        if they aren’t able to give their
        perspective because it has to
        be 100% anonymous, it could
        work against their favor,” she
        said. However, Blake did not
        completely dismiss the idea. “I
        think there’s room to explore
        this possibility, and if there is a

        solution in which this is possible and makes the process even

        more fair, then I don’t see why
        it couldn’t be implemented.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Notwithstanding the issues

        discussed in this article–potential internal bias, and whether

        anonymity is the solution to it,
        or a hindrance for students who

        might wish to defend themselves with the nuances and

        uniqueness of each case–all
        students are welcome to join
        the CHB. The requirements
        are good social and academic
        standing, and uphold the Honor
        Code.
