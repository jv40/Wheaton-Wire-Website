        A lot has changed in the Wheaton
        dining scene since we left campus
        in May. A nonexhaustive list of
        these changes includes the closures
        of the Balfour-Hood and Diana Davis Spencer cafes, the addition of a
        self-serve, stir-fry station to Chase
        Commons, the debut of a rotating
        selection of four hard-serve ice
        cream flavors, and the transition in
        Emerson Dining Hall to contactless
        ordering for meal options.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Balfour-Hood cafe has been
        replaced by a 24/7 “hot and ready”
        vending machine that offers bao,
        White Castle sliders, and more.
        There is also now a Smoodi
        smoothie machine, a sushi fridge,
        a fridge with (sometimes) fresh
        and cold sandwiches, and a Costa
        Coffee machine.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The Diana Davis Spencer cafe has
        been replaced with two refrigerators containing similar selections to
        those in the Balfour-Hood cafe, including cold sandwiches, hummus,
        a cheese platter, a small selection of
        soda, coffee, and water.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Many of these changes have been
        packaged by dining services as
        exciting enhancements, which, at
        first glance, they certainly appear
        to be. However, after interviewing
        six students, a trend of three main
        challenges emerged that seem to be
        a result of, or at least worsened by,
        these new changes.
    </p>


    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The first of these is raised lyons
        bucks prices. There likely would not
        have been as much an issue with a
        transition away from meal swipes
        at Emerson had prices remained at
        similar levels to last year.
    </p>

        Emerson Dining renamed to 1834 Grill is one among many changes to dining this year.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        However, according to Luke
        Droese ‘28, the prices are such that
        lyons bucks items have become “a
        little treat for yourself,” rather than
        a genuine, consistent option for
        meals. On the unlimited meal plan,
        he states that he has only spent his
        lyons bucks on meals “four times”
        and is already down to the range
        of $50 to $60. He added that he
        hasn’t bought anything else with
        lyons bucks.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Victoria Helena ‘27 said, “I
        don’t think there’s enough lyons
        bucks to fulfill everyone’s dietary
        needs,” which alludes to how some
        offerings in the “Hot and Ready”
        vending machine don’t constitute
        an entire meal replacement, and
        how lyons bucks in general may
        not stretch as far as they once did.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        An anonymous interviewee also
        commented on how most of the
        food stocked in this vending machine,
        as well as in others across
        campus, is not fresh, further
        deteriorating the value of meals offered
        at these locations.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Referencing the closed Bal-
        four-Hood and Diana Davis Spencer cafes,
        Avien Grable ‘28 said,
        “I don’t feel like I can get a coffee
        anywhere now, even though we
        have Emerson, because Emerson
        is more expensive.” For reference,
        these cafes sold coffee with options
        for adding milk, sweetener,
        and flavorings for under $4 last
        year. This year, coffee and other
        drinks at the Starbucks in Emerson
        (now the only serviced cafe on
        campus) can easily be more than
        $6.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The next challenge is struggles
        with schedules due to cafe closures.
        An anonymous interviewee
        said, “I’m an athlete, so I’ll go to
        lift in the morning, and immediately
        after lift…I’ll have a lab, so
        I can’t get breakfast during those
        hours because there’s no way I
        can go back to Chase. It’s just not
        accessible to go to a vending machine
        that may have run out, or not
        have fresh food.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        This issue also affects students
        with packed schedules, especially
        those grouped around lunch rush
        times. Due to other dining location
        closures and higher lyons buck
        prices, Chase is the choice for
        most students for lunch. The anonymous
        interviewee stated that because of this,
        it is a struggle to take
        30 minutes to decompress when
        you have the time free, because
        you need to be mindful of potential
        longer wait times in Chase.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The third struggle concerns
        allergen control and cross-contamination.
        Katelyn Spader ‘27
        raised concerns about the Emerson
        ordering system, specifically that
        it is not possible to order a sandwich
        without an ingredient if you
        are allergic to it. This limits some
        students’ ability to eat at Emerson.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Spader also addressed the Create
        Station in Chase. While the Create
        Station is a fun and creative new
        way to get food at Chase, it also
        should be used with caution if one
        has allergies, as complete separation
        of individual ingredients is not
        a 100% guarantee.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Last year, there were also concerns
        about the variety of options
        available to students with more
        general dietary restrictions, such
        as vegetarians and vegans. This
        year, with readily accessible food
        concentrated in a single location,
        these concerns have only grown
        alongside the cross-contamination
        worries.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Something that perhaps made
        these three issues more jarring to
        students, as Droese and Spader
        both clearly stated, was the lack
        of communication until very close
        to the start of the semester. Being
        informed only a short time before
        returning to campus, amidst other
        changes to non-dining areas of the
        college that were also lacking in
        communication, may have made
        some feel frustrated. At the end
        of the day, however, as the anonymous
        interviewee put it, “People
        forget we are quite lucky with
        what we have.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        As we mourn dining losses,
        we can also utilize the power of
        advocacy to deliver constructive
        feedback. For example, this concern
        for cross-contamination is not
        new; it has only been exacerbated
        by the concentration of in-person
        service at Chase. It poses a potential
        danger to students, and severely
        limits the options of students
        who have allergies due to a lack of
        control and supervision on allergens
        in the kitchen. So, this is an
        issue that Dining Services could,
        one hopes, prioritize rectifying
        feasibly.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Nourishment is essential for
        successful college students, and
        hopefully, through advocacy and
        respectful feedback, with this
        article as part of that effort,
        dining services’ administration will
        be prompted to seek a meaningful
        change by addressing student concerns.
