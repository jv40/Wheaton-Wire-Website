        Wheaton Events Board is
        saying goodbye to student government. In a special meeting
        on Sept. 2, Wheaton’s Student
        Government Association’s
        (SGA) Senate voted to approve
        a proposal which would remove
        Wheaton Events Board (WEB)
        as an SGA Executive Board.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The proposal “recommends
        transitioning the Wheaton Events
        Board (WEB) from an official
        Board of the Student Government
        Association (SGA) to an
        independent, student-run organization.”
        It contends that the move
        would make WEB more flexible
        and autonomous.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        A number of reasons were
        given for the change. Chief
        among these are the
        “bureaucratic constraints” the original
        structure placed on WEB, as well
        as the difference between both
        organizations’ missions. “As part
        of SGA, WEB often experiences
        role confusion,” the proposal
        states, “both internally and in
        how it is perceived by students.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “A big part of the proposal was
        showing the difference between
        the identity of SGA and WEB’s
        purpose,” said Ariel Ferreira,
        assistant director of student
        engagement and programs. A large
        part of Ferreira’s job is advising
        WEB and overseeing their event
        planning and budget.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “WEB is the event planning
        board of Wheaton College, by
        students, and SGA is really based
        on advocacy,” she said, “and
        their purpose is to advocate and
        make change in that way, where
        WEB is supposed to be focused
        on making impactful events for
        the whole campus.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Aside from the compatibility
        issues between the organizations,
        WEB was experiencing issues
        filling its president’s position due
        to the high commitment requirement
        of SGA. “We realized we
        were seeing burnout in the president’s role,
        and also the types
        of folks that normally want to
        be president of an events board
        aren’t really the type that would
        want to run for office,” she said.
        “We’ve seen consistently over
        the past two or three years, nobody
        runs for the position, they
        get written in, and then they feel
        like they have to accept it.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        In this past cycle, no one
        accepted the role. According to
        Ferreira, the lack of a president
        hampered WEB’s ability to plan
        events as usual and prompted an
        evaluation of the organization’s
        structure. The process began
        with speaking with returning
        WEB members and SGA’s Core
        Four, and from there, co-writing
        the proposal.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph_text">
        “It’s kind of impressive that it
        was pulled off the way it was,”
        Ferreira said, “because everyone
        was in great communication and,
        moreover, knew the facts and
        what they were talking about.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Going forward, WEB will still
        have a relationship with SGA, as
        Ferreira stressed. “We’re not
        actually breaking away from SGA,
        it’s just going through different
        avenues.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        No longer an executive board,
        however, WEB’s president will
        no longer be required to attend
        SGA Senate and Executive Board
        meetings, freeing up significant
        time in their schedule, according
        to the proposal’s proponents.
        There are plans for WEB to send
        a representative to Senate to provide updates.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        SGA Vice President Sara Milesi
        led the meeting in which the
        proposal was debated and was
        involved in the process. “SGA
        will still allocate funds to WEB
        and support their group, just in a
        different way,” she said. “WEB
        drafted this proposal with the
        help of SAIL (Student Activities,
        Involvement, and Leadership),
        who will be better equipped to
        provide resources to WEB.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        According to the proposal, budgets
        for WEB “will be submitted
        and reviewed through the same
        processes as other clubs and organizations.”
