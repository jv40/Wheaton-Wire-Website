        Founded in 1963, Bread and
        Puppet Theater is one of the
        oldest nonprofit political theater companies in the country. It
        recently kicked off its fall tour
        titled “Our Domestic Resurrection Revolution in Progress,”
        which showcases anti-empire
        art, acknowledges the earth, and
        draws attention to the victims of
        recent genocides. Drawing on
        themes of political action and
        necessities of outreach, Bread
        and Puppet promotes anti-war
        resistance throughout the United
        States and abroad, and promotes
        free expression. Their performances have centered around
        topics such as global warming,
        stop-and-frisk police laws, capitalism, war, and peace.

        Bread and Puppet’s unique display combines theater, art, bread,
        and 20-foot tall paper-mache
        puppetry with a belief in mortality and that good will eventually
        triumph over evil. Political art
        has long been a source of consciousness-spreading, prompting
        conversation and discussion
        while promoting debate and disagreement.

        While Bread and Puppet’s
        shows have always had underlying political messaging (marching against wars in Central
        America, Afghanistan, Iraq, and
        Palestine), their stories always
        depict scenes where positive political art and activism mix with
        entertainment.

        “Our Domestic Resurrection
        Revolution in Progress” tour
        kicked off in their home state
        of Vermont and will travel all
        throughout the United States.
        Bread and Puppet made an
        appearance in Cambridge Commons, where Wheaton students
        attended the event in an effort
        coordinated by Art Haus and
        Outdoors Haus/Club. While
        there was no ticket pricing for
        the show, Bread and Puppet did
        ask for $10-$20 donations, as
        they are a non-profit organization that mainly relies on funding
        from outside sources and grants.

        Their show in Cambridge
        Commons on Sep. 13 was funny, depressing, and politically
        heavy, with skits being spread
        out between funny scenarios featuring sheep, grasshoppers, and
        political dramedies. The performance also expressed the violent situations the United States
        government has inserted itself
        into both locally and abroad,
        and the fragility and resilience
        of both humanity and the earth.
        Scenes of couples with tea pots
        were mixed with overturning
        fascist power, the importance of
        minimum-wage workers’ rights,
        and the urgency of stopping the
        Palestinian genocide.

        When one of the performers,
        Anthony Sutton, was about the
        work he does, he noted that “I
        do this because the world around
        you and how you interact with
        it is always going to influence
        your art-and this [political arts in
        theatre] is a great intersection of
        that.”
