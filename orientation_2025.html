        Campus sprang to life on Friday, Aug. 22, as Wheaton officially welcomed the incoming
        class of 2029. With new students
        all gathered on Chapel Field for
        the welcome ceremony, orientation leaders burst out onto the
        grassy expanse, throwing beach
        balls, pom-poms, beads, and
        glasses into the crowd as the hit
        song “Thunderstruck” blasted
        from the speakers.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Ariel Ferreira, SAIL’s Assistant
        Director of Student Engagement
        and Programs, credits SAIL
        Director Rachel Pink with the
        Thunderstruck intro idea, saying
        it was inspired by the TikTok
        trend based on the Dallas Cowboys’ cheerleaders’ routine.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “It’s something that this generation, they easily recognize,”
        said Ferreira. “So that’s why we
        leaned into that to bring that sense
        of familiarity to something new.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Wheaton’s fall 2025 Orientation programming spanned four
        days and presented new students with opportunities to learn
        community guidelines, become
        familiar with campus, and socialize with their class. As part of a
        collective effort by SAIL, there
        were fewer mandatory ‘information’ sessions than in years past,
        and those that remained rarely
        ran longer than an hour.
    </p>


    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “We really focused on this year
        adding a more practical aspect to
        Orientation; less talking at students and more hands-on, doing
        the things that they really need to
        learn,” commented Ferreira.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Additional changes to this
        year’s Orientation included
        extending OL training to four
        days instead of three, as well
        as dropping the total number
        of OLs from roughly 30 to 20.
        These adjustments, however,
        only served to strengthen the
        group’s chemistry.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Katelyn Spader ’27, who was
        an orientation leader in both
        2024 and 2025, noted that, “It
        felt like we really had the chance
        to sit with each other, talk with
        each other, problem solve with
        each other, bond over our shared
        experiences.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        This year’s orientation coordinator, Jaedyn Williams ’27,
        arrived on campus on July 7 to
        work alongside the SAIL staff
        and plan social events that would
        take place alongside the mandatory information sessions.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “Jaedyn certainly hit it out of the
        park in terms of really addressing
        all the needs of all different types
        of Wheaton students, and made
        it more accessible to everybody,”
        Ferreira said.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        About a month later, Head
        Orientation Leaders Abby Breitenbach ’26,
        Anya O’Brien ’26, and
        Dhwanil Shah ’27 arrived at Wheaton to
        coordinate the upcoming OL
        training, which ran from Aug. 18
        until Aug. 21. Then came the real
        test, as on Friday the 22nd, the new
        students began moving in.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        When asked about the first day of
        Orientation, first-year Abbie Rock
        ’29 noted that, “It was intimidating,
        but also really exciting because
        it’s a completely new experience.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Rock also commented on the
        convenience of having the full
        Orientation schedule posted on the
        Wheaton website, and mentioned
        how the social events helped her
        get to know her classmates. “I met
        lots of people,” she said, “and now
        I feel like I’m more familiar with
        the people on my floor… Now, we
        all kind of know each other, and I
        heard some fun stories, and I met
        some cool people.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Some of the social programs
        included a bonfire at the Meadows
        fire pit, a pep rally hosted by the
        Wheaton Athletic Mentors, and a
        screening of “Monsters University”
        out on the Dimple. Two additional events,
        Glow Night and Craft
        Night, took place simultaneously
        next to each other on the night of
        Aug. 23, the former in The Dimple
        and the latter in Emerson Dining
        Hall.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Commenting on the decision to
        run both programs in such close
        proximity, Spader said it “created
        an environment where people were
        willing to go to both events, not
        just one or the other.”
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        When asked about the highlights
        of Orientation, Rock noted that, “I
        really liked all the games and stuff
        they had us do… and they also
        had the traditions with the candle
        lighting around the Dimple, which
        I thought was really nice.”

    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        The candle lighting ceremony
        was also a highlight for Spader,
        but for a very different reason. She
        described how, in the middle of
        the event, the sprinklers went off,
        spraying water all over the grass
        and even some of the people standing in the circle. While unforeseen,
        the chaotic moment offered the
        first-years a moment to laugh and
        bond as a class.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “Down the line, people are going
        to be like, ‘remember when we
        were doing the candle lighting and
        we got hit with the sprinkler?’”
        Spader quipped.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Ferreira’s personal highlight
        turned out to be the orientation
        team itself.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        “The student-led aspect of Orientation
        is so special to me,” she said.
        “It’s just such a rewarding thing to
        see orientation leaders come in on
        that first day of training; they learn
        so much, and then they’re really
        thrown into putting their skills to
        use. We were really lucky this year
        to have such a great group that was
        ready to go, and so willing to give
        back to fellow Wheaties.”
