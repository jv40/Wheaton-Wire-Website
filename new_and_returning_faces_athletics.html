        Wheaton Athletics saw a big
        change over the summer with two
        new coaches hired, three coaches
        promoted, and two changes in administrative roles. New to Whea
        ton are Dan Tischler, the head
        baseball coach, and Lindsey Keen,
        the artistic swimming coach. Both
        have extensive experience in their
        sports and have set goals for both
        this season and future years.</p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Tischler previously was at
        Boston College as an assistant
        coach for 2 seasons and spent 11
        seasons prior to that at Columbia
        University as an assistant coach
        and associate head coach. He said
        being at Wheaton brings “more
        responsibility for every facet of
        the program than I have ever
        had. From organizing practice,
        to alumni relations, to secondary
        duties within the department,
        there’s just more. It is an exciting opportunity.” He plans for
        this year’s team to be “one of the
        most competitive in our conference,” one that other schools are
        scared to play.</p>

        In the administrative office, Lisa Yenush '90 took on the title of
        Interim Senior Director of Athletics after previously being Associate
        Director. While the role is temporary in nature, she is very excited
        about all the recent changes, from new coaches to new programs.
        Yenush was both a student athlete and resident advisor during her time
        at Wheaton as a student. "My job is to support (others in athletics)
        as best as I can," she said. This fall marks the beginning of her 13th
        year at Wheaton and she is "oozing with pride" for the school.

        Keen joins the artisic swimming team from the Pacific Wabes club artistic
        swimming team in Seattle, after being approached for the position by USA
        Artistic Swimming CEO Adam Andrasko. Keen sees this as a new opportunity,
        as the collegiate system has various intricacies that the club system does
        not. She noted that, "I had the support of USA Artistic Swimming, which
        gave me the confidence to pursue this." Additionally, this new role offers
        her the ability to work with higher level, more intense athletes. Keen
        mentioned that Wheaton "felt like home," during her interviews with the
        athletics team and athletes. In her first season with Wheaton she is
        hoping to get the team "back on the map as a real contender for top
        three," and to "be a threat again."

        Brian Walmsley, the previous head coach of men's basketball for 28
        years, is now the Senior Associate Director for Athletics. Yenush noted
        how Walmsley's transition was seamless and how he has everyone's trust.
        Alex DuBrow '20 takes the place of Walmsley as the Interim Head Coach,
        an advancement from his prior position as Assistant Men's Basketball
        Coach for the past two years. He noted that the role is similar, but with
        more responsibility. "I was fortunate that Coach Walmsley gave me a lot of
        responsibility within all aspects of the program, so stepping into this new
        role I feel comfortable," he commented. DuBrow competed on the men's
        basketball team as a student before graduating from Wheaton in 2020.

        Alexander Evans and Luis Platas have also been promoted from their past
        positions to head coaches. Evans was just formally named the head coach
        for both the women and men's cross country teams as he enters his sixth
        season at Wheaton. Platas is now the head coach for the men's tennis
        program, with Dan Munsey becoming the Director of Tennis but continuing
        his role as head coach for the women's program. More information on these
        promotions can be found at wheatoncollegelyons.com.
