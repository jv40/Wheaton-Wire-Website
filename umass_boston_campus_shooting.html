        Police rushed to the University of Massachusetts Boston campus after
        gunshots were reported at 3:43 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 11.
        The threat was deemed clear by 5:11 p.m. through an emergency alert sent by the school.
        Boston Police Department troopers were deployed after the report came in, but deemed the campus
        safe shortly after.

        UMass Boston had posted an X warning to avoid the residential hall East Building for a "public safety threat."
        Later, the school said there was a police incident near the Campus Center.

        Just barely a week prior, UMass Lowell secured a lockdown and police search on its
        campus caused by confusion of a teenage boy's airsoft rifle on Wednesday, Sept. 3.
        Around 2:30 p.m., the school sent out a campus wide alert that a sighting
        of a person with a gun was seen around the Riverview Suites on the South Campus.
        A complete lockdown was initiated and all classes were canceled.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        There were no reported shots fired, so the lockdown ended at 5:15 p.m.
        The police searched throughout the night for the suspect, but confirmed
        on Thursday it was a teenage boy with an airsoft replica weapon.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        Once the threat had been cleared on Thursday, Umass Lowell's Chancellor
        Julie Chen shared a statement with the campus to express gratitude to those
        who helped address the threat.
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph_text">
        "This incident understandably caused fear and concern, but throughout it all,
        you've demonstrated the very best of our River Hawk community," said Chen
        to the students, faculty, and law enforcement.
    </p>
